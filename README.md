# Bragg_Diffraction_1D_Simulation
Numerical simulation of Bragg diffraction in 1D periodic structures. Validates wave propagation through periodic potentials against analytical Bragg law (nλ = 2d·sinθ). Includes automated validation, comprehensive data export (CSV, JSON, PNG), and Google Drive integration for Colab.
